Created a matlab script for designing a radar ground station of certain range and navigation of 6 swarm drones inside the radar. Whenever a intruder drone enters the range, the swarm drones passes the trajectory towards the target uniformly and kill it. Deployed a communication between the drones and radar ground station using mavlink protocol with the help of UAV toolbox in matlab. The intruder drone was found by the ground station and passed the attack command to the drones. The swarm drone which is nearby the intruder drone will capture the image before shooting. The data including the captured photo and coordinate of the intruder drone was encrypted and sent to the radar ground station. The password will be sent separately.
